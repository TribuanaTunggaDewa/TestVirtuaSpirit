Test React Native Developer [Junior]

## Question:
### 1. Why did you choose React-Native?

### Answer: I chose react native for some reason as follows:
    1. Large and powerful community, I chose react 
    native as the mobile hybrid development Framework, 
    because it has a large andstrong community that looks
    from how many communities contribute to the react native ecosystem Own.
    2. The programming language base, the programming language base used by react native itself is JavaScript which is 
    one of the most popular languages. With fairly popular languages and a large community and a very rich ecosystem will certainly benefit us from solving a problem 
    with the react native framework. 
    3. Proved, many popular technology companies are using react 
    native for their app development which can be viewed at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase
